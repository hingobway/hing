<h6><span class="scnuml">1</span>INT. GAMING CRIB - DAY<span class="scnumr">1</span></h6>
<div class="action"><p>It’s a comfortable gaming room in the afternoon. GAMECUBE, WII, and N64 are sitting on the couch; DS is sitting in a chair alongside them. They are all playing Super Smash Bros: Brawl on the TV in front of them.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">N64</p><p class="parenthetical">(quietly, then grows)</p><p>Aww yeah... c’mon, c’mon... YEAHH!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>N64 punches GAMECUBE off the edge of the map.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WII</p><p class="parenthetical">(taunting)</p><p>Ooooh, kinda rough for you there, Cubey.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE drops his controller on the floor angrily.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">GAMECUBE</p><p>Ok, I’m done with this game. All I need is <em>my</em> controller and I’d kick all of your asses...</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE gets up to get his controller.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">GAMECUBE (CONT.)</p><p>And everybody knows that Melee is much better anyway.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WII</p><p>Doesn’t matter what controller you use, you know you can’t win this.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE walks over to plug in HIS CONTROLLER.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">GAMECUBE</p><p class="parenthetical">(as he sits)</p><p>Yeah, cuz Brawl is slow and unbalanced, and the controls are terrible!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WII</p><p>Well Melee’s entire competitive basis is centered around a glitch!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">N64</p><p>Come on, guys! Obviously the original Smash Bros is the best!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">DS</p><p>You’re just stuck in the past! Smash 4 is the best by far!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">GAMECUBE</p><p class="parenthetical">(heavily taunting)</p><p>Whatever, at least we can agree that Brawl is the <em>worst</em> by far.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>WII is enraged. He runs at GAMECUBE and wraps his WIIMOTE NUNCHUKS around his neck. N64 jabs Wii in the back with his N64 CONTROLLER. GameCube uses this opportunity to grab HIS OWN CONTROLLER. He spins up his controller, holding it by the cable like a ball and chain, and uppercuts Wii off his feet and onto the ground. GameCube, N64, and DS are all facing each other, ready to fight, when suddenly…</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">DECLAN</p><p class="parenthetical">(in a Declan scream)</p><p>GUYS!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>FIGHTERS form a tableau as they freeze and look in DECLAN’s direction.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">DECLAN (CONT.)</p><p class="parenthetical">(awkward, like he’s trying to imitate the cool kids)</p><p>“Come at me bros!”</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>DECLAN does some sick KINECT dancing.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">GAMECUBE</p><p class="parenthetical">(shouts)</p><p>XBox, explode.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>XBOX explodes and kills DECLAN. GAMECUBE doesn’t get a chance to celebrate, however, because DS launches his stylus into GameCube’s eye.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE and N64 charge at DS holding their CONTROLLERS, but are stopped because they are plugged into their consoles. They both run to unplug, but N64 is attacked by WII using his WIIMOTE NUNCHUCKS.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE pulls his GAMECUBE out of his bag after unplugging his CONTROLLER and smashes WII with it. He turns to N64 but is blinded by the CARTRIDGE DUST that has been blown in his eyes.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>N64 jabs GAMECUBE while he is blinded. WII is getting up and is about to charge into the battle, when suddenly he is attacked by DECLAN with PS MOVE CONTROLLERS.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">DECLAN</p><p>Wii motion controls will never compare to Playstation!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>DECLAN punches WII tons of times really fast but is one-hit KO’d by Wii. Wii turns again to charge into the battle, but is knocked over by a keyboard to the back of the head.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A wired mouse suddenly wraps around N64’s neck and he is thrown to the ground. DS braces to fight his opponent...PC. They circle each other for a second, then DS charges towards PC and flicks his top screen at him several times. PC adjusts his glasses, pulls out a laptop, and knocks DS out with one flick of his screen.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GAMECUBE gets up behind PC. PC turns and they face each other. GAMECUBE suddenly flings his controller at PC, who dodges it, and yanks the cable out of his hand. GAMECUBE, enraged, charges at PC with his gamecube and swings at his head. PC ducks and shoots compressed air up into GAMECUBE’s eyes. GAMECUBE staggers backwards and trips on the mess of cables from the computer behind him.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>WII gets up once more, picking up the gamecube controller next to him and plugging it into his wii. He charges at PC, who has his back to WII, and swings the controller at his head. PC uses his higher FPS to move out of the way. WII, not expecting to miss, over-swings and falls over.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>PC stands over WII with his keyboard, ready to finish him off. He pulls back to swing, but right as he swings down the video stops for a windows update.</p></div>
