host: What do you think of Shylock?<br>
<br>
Portia: He's rich, but too Jewish. <br>
<br>
Host:Ok, well what do you think about Antonio?<br>
<br>
Portia:He seems nice. What with risking his life so I can marry someone who isn't black.<br>
<br>
Host: Just charming. What do you think of Bassanio.<br>
<br>
Portia: Well he isn't a drunk, black, or Jewish soooo-<br>
<br>
Host: Ok well that's all the time we have today-<br>
<br>
Portia: I wasn't finished being racist… ugh I mean reasonably picky<br>
<br>
Host:Ok well that's all we can do for today<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Host: Shylock, What do you know about the others?<br>
<br>
Shylock: Antonio discusts me. He has spit on me and called me names for a long time but now I have the leverage on him. He is crumbling and I will be able to cut 1 lb of his flesh soon.<br>
<br>
Host: What do you think about Morroco?<br>
<br>
Shylock: Well I don’t really know him very well but I know that he is not Christian which means that he is yet another person who isn’t on my side.<br>
<br>
Host: And Portia?<br>
<br>
Shylock: Well I dont know her very well either but she seems like she is in over her head. She inherited so much money and she is just a child. She also seems like a cocky little bitch.<br>
<br>
BC:<br>
Host: Antonio what do you think about the other contestants?<br>
<br>
Antonio: Shylock is a jew pig, he does not know what he is talking about his religion brings shame to him.<br>
<br>
Host: What about Morocco?  <br>
<br>
Antonio: Morocco is darker than night I can’t even see him, His hair curls the devils bush, His shade makes him look like he has been burnt to a crisp, he is a filthy rich ******<br>
<br>
Host: What do you think about Portia<br>
<br>
Antonio: Portia is the finest maiden in the land, No coon nor pig is fit to wed her, She deserves a great powerful christian white man. She is the thickest in thy land<br>
<br>
Host: Ok Antonio, you are by far the most racist man here<br>
<br>
<br>
CO: HOST <br>
This question is for Antonio and Shylock, If Antonio gets a pound of his flesh cut off, who is to blame?<br>
<br>
Shylock <br>
It is obviously Antonio’s fault. We made a fair deal, and it is his if he can’t come up with the money, but he agreed to the terms.<br>
<br>
Antonio<br>
It is obviously the jew’s fault. He should never have been charging interest in the first place, so we would not have had to make any terms to make up for the lost interest.<br>
<br>
Host <br>
Interesting. Now Portia and Morocco, What are your feelings for eachother?<br>
<br>
Morocco <br>
She is the fairest lady in all the land, and I am the fairest man. We were made for each other. We shall be wed.<br>
<br>
Portia<br>
<br>
Poor Morocco, the sun has cursed him. How shall I put it, He blends with the jet on my rug in which I wipe my feet. I Have no desire to be wed to a (censored)<br>
<br>
Host<br>
Wow.<br>
