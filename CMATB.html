<div class="action"><p>MIKI presses play, and the track PLAYS. He listens through headphones and seems deeply moved and into it. The audience does not hear.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>NATHAN is reading a book outside. He has an empty cup with a straw next to him. He picks it up and tries to drink from it. Nothing comes out so he sucks harder and harder, making loud noises and squeezing his face more and more. Camera shakes more and more as his face gets sucked in. Finally MIKI enters.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MIKI</p><p>Hey Nathan!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>NATHAN whirls around, his face still extremely squished and angry. He tries to speak but cannot open his mouth.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NATHAN</p><p>Captain, I would by no means consider you my friend, but I would consider your music to be my friend. I am very lonely. All you need to do to get me to join you is get me a soda…</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MIKI</p><p>Oh yeah sorry.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>MIKI opens the door and enters the basement. We hear TRIPPING and CURSING and a few CRASHES. Miki is clearly having trouble navigating the dark basement. Finally he emerges, proudly showing the can of soda he has retrieved.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NATHAN</p><p>Oh no I don’t like root beer, that’s for my friend. Could you get me a Coke? They’re right next to the root beer.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>MIKI sighs and walks back in with more CRASHING and CURSING. He emerges once more. He holds up the coke.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NATHAN</p><p>Hell yeah boi!</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MIKI</p><p>What are you talking about? I just got here. You can be so dumb sometimes.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MICHAEL</p><p>No no I just need—</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MIKI</p><p>Yeah that seems like the best solution.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>MIKI stands up and slowly backs into the closet and closes the door. The slower the better, and the more staring during this moment, even better.</p></div>
