<h3 id="section-1-rankings">Section 1: Rankings</h3>

<p>Our current ranking system provides some customization of rankings– a 3 level system like our own runs well for the most part, but sometimes you need a few more roles so more people can have some kind of privilege. Because there are people in the Discord who deserve to have some control, but leveling them up to Mod rank is just too much. Also, if someone has done something that warrants punishment, it is extremely difficult to punish them because of the fact that @everyone rights are very difficult to revoke, even from specific people, and every right must be removed manually.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution? Here is the ranking system I suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rank Suggestions</strong> <br>
  Each rank has all the rights of all the level below it as well.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>@everyone - <em>absolutely no permissions</em></li>
  <li>@Time Out - *a level with minimal permissions. negotiable, but I’m thinking the following: <br>
  <ul><li>read messages</li>
  <li>join #general</li></ul></li>
  <li>@normal - <em>the average user. what @everyone is right now.</em></li>
  <li>@Mod1 - <em>a very low level mod with some basic nominal rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>manage emojis</li>
  <li>send TTS</li>
  <li>mention @everyone</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Mod2 - <em>slightly higher level moderator with some voice management rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>server mute users</li>
  <li>server deafen users</li>
  <li>move users to different voice channels</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager1 - <em>control over chat and a few other permissions.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>pin messages</li>
  <li>delete messages</li>
  <li>manage nicknames</li>
  <li>manage webhooks (don’t think this will mean much to most people but it will to a few)</li>
  <li>kick users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager2 - <em>starts adding control over server settings.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>add/edit/delete chatrooms</li>
  <li>add/edit/delete voice channels</li>
  <li>ban users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Admin - <em>every control except editing their own role</em></li>
  <li>@owner - <em>not a real role, but Nathan has control over actually everything</em></li>
  </ol>
