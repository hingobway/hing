<h3 id="section-1-rankings">Section 1: Rankings</h3>

<p>Our current ranking system provides some customization of rankings– a 3 level system like our own runs well for the most part, but sometimes you need a few more roles so more people can have some kind of privilege. Because there are people in the Discord who deserve to have some control, but leveling them up to Mod rank is just too much. Also, if someone has done something that warrants punishment, it is extremely difficult to punish them because of the fact that @everyone rights are very difficult to revoke, even from specific people, and every right must be removed manually.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution? Here is the ranking system I suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rank Suggestions</strong> <br>
  Each rank has all the rights of all the level below it as well.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>@everyone - <em>absolutely no permissions</em></li>
  <li>@Time Out - *a level with minimal permissions. negotiable, but I’m thinking the following: <br>
  <ul><li>read messages</li>
  <li>join #general</li></ul></li>
  <li>@normal - <em>the average user. what @everyone is right now.</em></li>
  <li>@Mod1 - <em>a very low level mod with some basic nominal rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>manage emojis</li>
  <li>send TTS</li>
  <li>mention @everyone</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Mod2 - <em>slightly higher level moderator with some voice management rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>server mute users</li>
  <li>server deafen users</li>
  <li>move users to different voice channels</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager1 - <em>control over chat and a few other permissions.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>pin messages</li>
  <li>delete messages</li>
  <li>manage nicknames</li>
  <li>manage webhooks (don’t think this will mean much to most people but it will to a few)</li>
  <li>kick users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager2 - <em>starts adding control over server settings.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>add/edit/delete chatrooms</li>
  <li>add/edit/delete voice channels</li>
  <li>ban users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Admin - <em>every control except editing their own role</em></li>
  <li>@owner - <em>not a real role, but owner has control over actually everything</em> <br>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Edits and suggestions are welcome, but the key point here is that 9 ranks creates so much more customization than the 3-4 we have right now, and will give us a chance to give many more people some kind of role and some kind of control, as well as make sure it is as easy as possible to change people’s role in the group.</p>



<h3 id="section-2-bots-and-welcoming-procedures">Section 2: Bots and Welcoming Procedures</h3>

<p>Let’s put it this way– it’s a bit of a free-for-all right now in terms of discord bots. People post bot commands in all chatrooms, people spam bot commands and mess with songs– it’s not very conducive to a solid and well-controlled group chat. So there are a few things I think we should do regarding this system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bot Restrictions</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>All bot commands should be restricted to the #cmds chatroom (see <a href="#section-3-chatrooms">chatrooms</a> for more on this)</li>
  <li>Bot permission levels should be given out, not just taken by high-level admins <br>
  <ul><li>possibly associated with a @manager1 status, but it’s debatable</li></ul></li>
  <li>A main management bot must be chosen. Conditions may include: <br>
  <ul><li>close to 100% uptime</li>
  <li>autorole capabilities</li>
  <li>custom command capabilities</li>
  <li>chatroom restrictions</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:roadsterfoster@gmail.com?subject=%5BDisMan%5D+Management+Bot+Recommendation">Add your suggestions!</a></li></ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcoming Procedures are currently completely obsolete– it’s one of the features of Discord we truly haven’t explored at all. Some of the things involve the ranking system, but there are some other options as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Welcoming Procedures</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>On joining, automatically assign the @normal role to the user.</li>
  <li>Various messages should be triggered on entering: <br>
  <ul><li>General message in chat announcing a new user</li>
  <li>DM to the user highlighting: </li>
  <li>rules <br>
  <ul><li>welcome message</li>
  <li>inner workings, etc</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:roadsterfoster@gmail.com?subject=%5BDisMan%5D+Welcoming+DM+Idea">Add yours!</a></li></ul></li></ul></li>
  <li>t</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
