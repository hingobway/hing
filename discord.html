<h3 id="section-1-rankings">Section 1: Rankings</h3>

<p>Our current ranking system provides some customization of rankings– a 3 level system like our own runs well for the most part, but sometimes you need a few more roles so more people can have some kind of privilege. Because there are people in the Discord who deserve to have some control, but leveling them up to Mod rank is just too much. Also, if someone has done something that warrants punishment, it is extremely difficult to punish them because of the fact that @everyone rights are very difficult to revoke, even from specific people, and every right must be removed manually.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution? Here is the ranking system I suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rank Suggestions</strong> <br>
  Each rank has all the rights of all the level below it as well.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>@everyone - <em>absolutely no permissions</em></li>
  <li>@timeout - *a level with minimal permissions. negotiable, but I’m thinking the following: <br>
  <ul><li>read messages</li>
  <li>join #main</li>
  <li>add reactions</li></ul></li>
  <li>@normal - <em>the average user. what @everyone is right now.</em></li>
  <li>@Mod1 - <em>a very low level mod with some basic nominal rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>manage emojis</li>
  <li>send TTS</li>
  <li>mention @everyone</li>
  <li>create instant invites</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Mod2 - <em>slightly higher level moderator with some voice management rights.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>server mute users</li>
  <li>server deafen users</li>
  <li>move users to different voice channels</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager1 - <em>control over chat and a few other permissions.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>pin messages</li>
  <li>delete messages</li>
  <li>manage nicknames</li>
  <li>manage webhooks (don’t think this will mean much to most people but it will to a few)</li>
  <li>kick users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Manager2 - <em>starts adding control over server settings.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>add/edit/delete chatrooms</li>
  <li>add/edit/delete voice channels</li>
  <li>ban users</li></ul></li>
  <li>@Admin - <em>every control except editing their own role</em></li>
  <li>@owner - <em>not a real role, but owner has control over actually everything</em> <br>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Edits and suggestions are welcome, but the key point here is that 9 ranks creates so much more customization than the 3-4 we have right now, and will give us a chance to give many more people some kind of role and some kind of control, as well as make sure it is as easy as possible to change people’s role in the group.</p>



<h3 id="section-2-bots-and-welcoming-procedures">Section 2: Bots and Welcoming Procedures</h3>

<p>Let’s put it this way– it’s a bit of a free-for-all right now in terms of discord bots. People post bot commands in all chatrooms, people spam bot commands and mess with songs– it’s not very conducive to a solid and well-controlled group chat. So there are a few things I think we should do regarding this system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bot Restrictions</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>All bot commands should be restricted to the #bot chatroom (see <a href="#section-3-chatrooms">chatrooms</a> for more on this)</li>
  <li>Bot permission levels should be given out, not just taken by high-level admins <br>
  <ul><li>possibly associated with a @manager1 status, but it’s debatable</li></ul></li>
  <li>A main management bot must be chosen. Conditions may include: <br>
  <ul><li>close to 100% uptime</li>
  <li>autorole capabilities</li>
  <li>custom command capabilities</li>
  <li>chatroom restrictions</li>
  <li><strong>My vote is Mee6. Unless there are objections, I’m going ahead with this.</strong></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:roadsterfoster@gmail.com?subject=%5BDisMan%5D+Management+Bot+Recommendation">Add your suggestions!</a></li></ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcoming Procedures are currently completely obsolete– it’s one of the features of Discord we truly haven’t explored at all. Some of the things involve the ranking system, but there are some other options as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Welcoming Procedures</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>On joining, automatically assign the @normal role to the user.</li>
  <li>Various messages should be triggered on entering: <br>
  <ul><li>General message in chat announcing a new user</li>
  <li>DM to the user highlighting:  <br>
  <ul><li>welcome message</li>
  <li>inner workings, etc</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:roadsterfoster@gmail.com?subject=%5BDisMan%5D+Welcoming+DM+Idea">Add yours!</a></li></ul></li></ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="section-3-chatrooms">Section 3: Chatrooms</h3>

<p>The three chatrooms we have currently are usually more or less fine– normal chatting happens in #general, bot commands go in #music, and tech help goes in #tech-sup. However, there are some issues with this system. Often people don’t follow the rules of what goes where, or sometimes it just isn’t clear. That being said, here are the changes I think should be made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chatroom Fixes</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Impose strict deletion rules on content that isn’t where it belongs– anything that is in the wrong chat should be deleted</li>
  <li>Impose punishments on users who repeatedly and purposefully misuse chatrooms</li>
  <li>Not all chatrooms have to let everyone talk. In other words, Instead of relying on pinned messages, you could have chatrooms as a “rules” page, a “messageboard”, etc. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All of that being said, here are the chatrooms that I suggest. The denotation in brackets suggests the Room Class that chatroom falls under. If it doesn’t have one, only server rules apply. See <a href="#section-4-rules">rules</a> for more on this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>List of Chatrooms</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>#welcome [m] - <em>the place where you start. no talking aloud, from anyone</em> <br>
  <ul><li>anyone can be here</li>
  <li>no one can chat here</li>
  <li>#general could become this– this is because #general has certain limitations on it that a new one would not. Don’t worry, message history will stay if people wish to see it, but it will be mainly just for new users.</li></ul></li>
  <li>#rules [iii] - <em>the place to see general rules for the group. no chatting aloud(*)</em> <br>
  <ul><li>anyone @manager2+ can post here</li>
  <li>posting should be pretty sporadic, only if new rules are decided on</li>
  <li>anyone can see this chat, no matter what</li></ul></li>
  <li>#main [ii] - <em>the replacement for #general</em> <br>
  <ul><li>@normal+ can chat here, post whatever here</li>
  <li>main chatroom to chat however people like</li>
  <li>no bots should function here</li></ul></li>
  <li>#bot [i]- <em>a chat for posting bot commands</em> <br>
  <ul><li>everyone should have this channel muted</li>
  <li>all bot interactions should be limited to here.</li></ul></li>
  <li>#highclass [ii]- <em>chatroom for “high-class citizens” of the server</em> <br>
  <ul><li>anyone @mod1+ can chat here.</li>
  <li>a hangout for the slightly cool people on the server</li></ul></li>
  <li>#midmods [ii]- <em>chatroom for relatively top-notch citizens</em> <br>

  <li>#admin [ii]- <em>chatroom for the true OGs</em> <br>
  <ul><li>only @admin+ can go here</li>
  <li>we talkin white-tie exclusive</li></ul></li>

  <ul><li>@everyone can chat here. (be scared.)</li>
  <li>a home for spam, more bot commands here</li>
  <li>very minimal rules</li></ul></li>
  <li>#announce [iii]- <em>a place everyone can read, few can post</em> <br>

  <li>anyone can submit posts to be put here, just dm your local admin</li></ul></li>
  <li>#help [iii]- <em>Need help? this is the place for you.</em> <br>
  <ul><li>@normal+ can post here</li>
  <li>rules maintained strictly</li>
  <li>only serious messages, all others deleted, with punishment</li>
  <li>ask for hw help, discord help, help with running a game, get assistance for projects, etc</li></ul></li>

<h3 id="section-4-rules">Section 4: Rules</h3>

<p>This chatroom is fun, and it should be as such, so the rules here should make up a pretty short list. Let’s keep the bare minimum while still keeping things operational.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How Rules Will Show Up:</strong> <br>
  Pretty simple. All rules go in the #rules channel. New rules are lower, old rules are higher. Each channel has a set of rules that is pinned. In other words, channel specific rules each have one message that is edited, all-server rules go directly into the chat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, here are the rules I would start with. Server Rules (of course) apply to all other sections, it’s not one or the other. Please note, immediate action <em>“- will be written like this”</em>, but <a href="#section-5-punishment">punishments can be found in the next section</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Rules</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>[s] Server Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>No pornography. Plain and simple. <em>- deleted ASAP.</em></li>
  <li>No hardcore bullying. You don’t have to be uber-pc, and you can make remarks at others’ expense. Just don’t constantly make fun of someone for their less controllable attributes (race, religion, etc) <em>- mods, but really anyone, should break it up.</em></li></ol></li>
  <li>[i] Class 1 Chatroom Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>Non-serious; spam is allowed.</li>
  <li>(Suggestion) Turn off your notifications for this channel. </li>
  <li>(Mods) Things shouldn’t be pinned here. Organization is minimal, and thus the pins would be useless.</li></ol></li>
  <li>[ii] Class 2 Chatroom Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>Non-serious.</li>
  <li>No spam. Definition of spam is at the discretion of any mod. <em>- at discretion of mod, messages may be deleted</em></li></ol></li>
  <li>[iii] Class 3 Chatroom Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>Serious chat.</li>
  <li>Think carefully before posting any message in one of these.</li>
  <li>If your message is a joke, prepare to die. <em>- at discretion of mod, messages <u>will</u> be deleted</em></li></ol></li>
  <li>[v] Voice Channel Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>Don’t be dumb.</li>
  <li>Don’t play music through your microphone. <em>- someone can call a mod in, who can and will mute you</em></li>
  <li>If you want to play something outside of the music bot, (1) ask others, and (2) use your audio drivers.</li></ol></li>
  <li>[m] Mod-Only Rules: <br>
  <ol><li>If you’re a mod, we trust you. Just be responsible.</li>
  <li>With any major changes to these, make sure to check in with someone higher rank than you. Not required, but it’d be nice. <em>- potentially your remark/rule could be revoked</em></li></ol></li>
